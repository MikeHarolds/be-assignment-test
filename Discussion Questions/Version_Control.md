# Version Control

### 1. Why is version control important in software development?
Version control is crucial for tracking every change in a codebase, enabling developers to revert to previous states, understand modifications, and manage different versions. It prevents accidental loss of work and provides a complete historical record, essential for debugging and auditing in software development.

### 2. How does version control help in team collaboration?
Version control allows multiple developers to work on the same project simultaneously without overwriting each other's work. It facilitates merging changes, resolving conflicts, and maintaining a shared, synchronized codebase. Teams can track who made which changes, enabling accountability and smoother integration of individual contributions into the main project.

### 3. What are the best practices for organizing a Git repository?
* **Main Branch (e.g., `main`/`master`):** Keep it always deployable/stable.
* **Feature Branches:** Create separate branches for new features or bug fixes.
* **Clear Commit Messages:** Write concise, descriptive messages explaining changes.
* **`.gitignore`:** Use it to exclude unnecessary files (e.g., build artifacts, `node_modules`).
* **Regular Pulls/Fetches:** Keep your local copy updated with remote changes.
* **Meaningful Naming:** Use clear names for branches and tags.
