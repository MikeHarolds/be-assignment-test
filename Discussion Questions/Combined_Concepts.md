# Combined Concepts

### 1. How would you explain the relationship between Node.js and version control in a development workflow?
Node.js projects, written in JavaScript, are managed by version control (like Git) to track source code (.js files), configuration (package.json), and build scripts. Git records every change, enables collaboration, and allows easy rollback for Node.js application development, ensuring project integrity and history.

### 2. What are the key considerations when setting up a new Node.js project with version control?
When setting up a new Node.js project with version control:

- .gitignore: Crucially, ignore node_modules/ and environment files (.env).
- package.json: Initialize and track this file for dependency management.
- Initial Commit: Commit basic project structure and package.json early.
- Branching Strategy: Plan a strategy (e.g., Git Flow, GitHub Flow) for team collaboration.

### 3. How can version control help in managing Node.js dependencies?

Version control primarily manages Node.js dependencies through package.json and package-lock.json. These files list the exact dependencies and their versions, ensuring consistent installations across environments. Developers commit these files, but not the node_modules.
