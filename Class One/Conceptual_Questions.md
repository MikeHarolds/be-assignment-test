# Conceptual Questions

**1. What is NPM and what role does it play in Node.js development?**

**NPM stands for Node Package Manager.**
It's the default package manager for Node.js, playing a crucial role in development by:

- Managing Packages: It allows developers to easily install, share, and manage reusable code packages (libraries, frameworks, tools) from a vast online registry.
- Dependency Management: It helps track and install all the necessary "dependencies" (other packages your project relies on) automatically, ensuring projects work correctly across different environments.
- Project Scripts: NPM also lets you define and run custom scripts for common tasks like testing, building, or deploying your Node.js application.
- It's essentially the central hub for Node.js's massive ecosystem, greatly accelerating development.

**Why is Node.js considered cross-platform, and what are the benefits of this feature?**

Node.js is considered cross-platform because it can run on various operating systems like Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification. This is due to its underlying V8 engine and its abstraction of system-level calls.

**Benefits:**

- Wider Reach: Developers can build applications that work on different systems, reaching a broader user base.
- Easier Development: Write code once, deploy anywhere, saving development time and effort.
- Flexible Deployment: Applications can be deployed to diverse server environments without compatibility issues.
- Cost-Effective: Reduces the need for separate development teams or infrastructure for each platform.

**3. What are built-in modules in Node.js, and why are they important?**

Built-in modules are pre-compiled, core functionalities included directly with Node.js upon installation. You don't need NPM to install them; you just require() them. Examples include fs (file system), http (HTTP server/client), path, and os.


They are crucial because they provide essential low-level capabilities for server-side programming. They allow Node.js applications to interact with the operating system, handle network communication, stream data, and manage paths, forming the bedrock upon which more complex applications and NPM packages are built.
