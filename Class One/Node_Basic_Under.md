# Basic Understanding
**1. What is Node.js and how does it differ from traditional server-side technologies?**
**Answer**
Node.js lets you run JavaScript outside the browser, primarily for server-side applications. Think of it as giving JavaScript the power to handle databases, files, and network requests on a server. It uses the same super-fast V8 engine as Chrome.

**2. Explain the relationship between Node.js and the V8 JavaScript engine.**
**Answer**
relationship between Node.js and the V8 JavaScript engine:

V8: Google's high-performance JavaScript engine (written in C++) that powers Chrome. It compiles JavaScript into machine code.
Node.js: An environment that uses V8 to run JavaScript outside the browser. It adds server-side capabilities (file access, networking).
Relationship: Node.js uses V8 to execute JavaScript. V8 is the engine; Node.js provides the environment and tools for server-side JavaScript development.

**3. What are the key features that make Node.js suitable for modern web applications?**

Node.js excels for modern web apps due to:

- Non-blocking, Event-Driven I/O: Handles many concurrent requests efficiently without waiting, ideal for real-time apps (chats, live dashboards) and APIs.
- Single Language (JavaScript): Allows full-stack development with one language, streamlining teams and code reuse.
- Fast Execution (V8 Engine): Leverages Chrome's V8 engine for high performance.
- Rich Ecosystem (NPM): A vast repository of open-source packages accelerates development.
- Scalability: Its architecture supports building scalable applications, fitting well with microservices.
