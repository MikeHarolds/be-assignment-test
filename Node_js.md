# Node.js

### 1. How does Node.js's single-threaded nature affect its performance and scalability?

Node.js's single-threaded nature means it excels at concurrent I/O operations (network, database). It avoids thread overhead, leading to high throughput for web applications with many simultaneous connections. However, CPU-bound tasks can block the single thread, hindering performance and requiring solutions like worker threads or load balancing for true scalability.

### 2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an event-driven architecture?

##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Event-Driven Architecture:

**Advantages:**

1. Efficiency: Excellent for concurrent I/O, leading to high throughput.
2. Responsiveness: No blocking, so applications remain nimble.
3. Scalability: Efficient resource usage for many connections.
   
**Disadvantages:**

1. Complexity: Callback hell or managing asynchronous flows can be tricky.
2. Debugging: Tracing execution flow can be harder.
3. CPU-bound tasks: Can still block the single thread.

### 3. How does Node.js's non-blocking I/O model benefit web applications?

Node.js's non-blocking I/O model allows a web application to handle numerous concurrent user requests efficiently. Instead of waiting for a database query or file read to finish (blocking), the server immediately processes the next request. When an I/O operation completes, a callback is triggered. This prevents bottlenecks, ensuring the application remains responsive and can serve many users simultaneously, crucial for modern, high-traffic web services.
